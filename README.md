# She-Ra Character Selector

My first foray into React! Deployed on Netlify at https://she-ra-selector.netlify.com/

An interactive site that lets you click or navigate with your keyboard through a grid of characters. Renders information on that character as you select it!

Built using the new(ish) React hooks, `React.useState` and `React.useEffect`.
